    - Version 5.2 from 2016-11-08.
    - Other versions, including the nonfree versions, may also work, but are untested.
    - All its hardware requirements (It works with a wide variety of software; specifics forthcoming)
      - Resonant scanner
      - Fast Z piezo stage
      - Pockels cell controlled by a fast analogue output card
      - Post-Pockels power measurement
- Mesh Voxelisation by Adam A: [Matlab File Exchange 27390](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27390-mesh-voxelisation)
- STL File Reader by Eric Johnson: [Matlab File Exchange 22409](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22409-stl-file-reader)
- stlTools by Pau Mic√≥: [Matlab File Exchange 51200](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/51200-stltools)
- Significant Figures by Teck Por Lim: [Matlab File Exchange 10669](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10669-significant-figures)

# Installation:

- Install ScanImage in the MATLAB path
- Run ScanImage and set up your hardware
